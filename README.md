# LoL-Data-Viewer
A quick program designed to apply fliters to and view data out of a CSV file.

The CSV file to be read from should be stored in /Data/Data.csv.  The first line of it should be the column headers as normal.
The filters tab will then allow you to filter your data, and the second tab will allow you to view the data set which
meets your filters.
